Once the page is opened, a user is shown the homepage, on which one can see a beautiful cityscape to have a first impression on how a big city
in Germany can look like. Then, one is lead to scroll down by an animated arrow that points downwards, to explore more about Germany and the German
language. As, one scrolls down to see more sections of the homepage, one can gather knowledge of the German culture, meals, and of popular places in Germany
that many tourists like to visit. As a result, the homepage is the most important part of the website because it gives users broad ideas of what one could find in Germany, 
and of how wide of a variety of attractions, cultural knowledge, places and traditional meals there is to discover. 

Afterwards, the user is lead to the media page by clicking on a text on the homepage, in which I linked it, or one could simply click on 'Media' in the menu bar. 
On there, one can find a gallery of beautiful land- and cityscapes in Germany, listen to an audio of the German national anthem and watch videos to see beautiful parts of 
famous German places and to learn 40 important German words that one could use in Germany. This page gives a user a broader idea of how beautiful germany is, and helps one to 
get by in Germany, as a tourist. Furthermore, one who is then interested to visit Germany, can click on the 'Hotels' section in the menu bar to find examples of luxurious hotels 
in Germany and if they press on 'Emergency Contacts' in the footer or in the dropdown of the button called 'Contacts' in the menu bars, a user can find important German emergency numbers
