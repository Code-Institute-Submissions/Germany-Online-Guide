## Germany Online Guide
 
My project focuses on Germany and its beautiful places, attractions, culture and its delicious food. 
It is a website that is aimed towards travellers, who are looking for interesting places to visit, are ready to get inspired by a new culture and 
are trying to find comfortable hotels and who want to have German emergency informations for safety. 


## UX

Once the page is opened, a user is shown the homepage, on which one can see a beautiful cityscape to have a first impression on how a big city
in Germany can look like. Then, one is lead to scroll down by an animated arrow that points downwards, to explore more about Germany and the German
language. As, one scrolls down to see more sections of the homepage, one can gather knowledge of the German culture, meals, and of popular places in Germany
that many tourists like to visit. As a result, the homepage is the most important part of the website because it gives users broad ideas of what one could find in Germany, 
and of how wide of a variety of attractions, cultural knowledge, places and traditional meals there is to discover. 

Afterwards, the user is lead to the media page by clicking on a text on the homepage, in which I linked it, or one could simply click on 'Media' in the menu bar. 
On there, one can find a gallery of beautiful land* and cityscapes in Germany, listen to an audio of the German national anthem and watch videos to see beautiful parts of 
famous German places and to learn 40 important German words that one could use in Germany. This page gives a user a broader idea of how beautiful germany is, and helps one to 
get by in Germany, as a tourist. Furthermore, one who is then interested to visit Germany, can click on the 'Hotels' section in the menu bar to find examples of luxurious hotels 
in Germany and if they press on 'Emergency Contacts' in the footer or in the dropdown of the button called 'Contacts' in the menu bars, a user can find important German emergency numbers
and German emergency words, which one could use for emergency situation in Germany. 

To conclude, this website is an online guide to Germany, which gives a user, who wants to travel touristic informations about Germany, so one has a broader idea of how Germany is.

### Mobile Responsives

* The live preview was used to check the devt tools and the different screen sizes of each page


## Bugs/Problems encountered

* Mobile responsiveness had some issues, when viewing 'inspect' to see the different screen sizes
    * The way I set the backgrounds of some sections caused them not to fill the entire screen on different devices, so I changed the codes
* My mentor told me that my bootstrap codes were formated wrongly
    * I repositioned the rows, columns and classes for the backgrounds of almost each section in the HTML codes


## Deployment
I pushed my Cloud9 workspace to my Github repository called Germany-Online-Guide through the command line. I did not use it so often at the beginning of my project
however, later as I kept progressing through my project, I was told to use it after almost each change I make. So, I have done so, until I finished it. 
My Github repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Rian1010/Germany-Online-Guide).

### Steps on how to push it:
1. git add .
2. git status (to check, if the right file/s have been added or not)
3. git commit -m "text input"
4. git remote add origin
5. git push -u origin master
6. Insert Github username
7. Insert Github password
